## About counter ‚≠ê<br><br>

1. A JavaScript counter is a small application or component built using JavaScript programming language that is used to increment or decrement a numerical value displayed on a web page.

2. JavaScript Logic: JavaScript is used to add interactivity to the counter. It involves defining functions to handle the increment and decrement operations, as well as updating the displayed value accordingly.

3. Increment Function: This function is triggered when the user clicks on the increment button. It increases the numerical value of the counter by a certain amount (e.g., by 1) and updates the display accordingly.

4. Decrement Function: Similarly, this function is triggered when the user clicks on the decrement button. It decreases the numerical value of the counter by a certain amount (e.g., by 1) and updates the display accordingly.

5. Display Update: After each increment or decrement operation, the JavaScript code updates the display of the counter to reflect the new numerical value.
